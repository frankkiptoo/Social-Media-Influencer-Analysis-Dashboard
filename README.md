## Project Highlights  
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Removed special characters, emojis, and duplicate records.  
  - Converted compact numeric formats (e.g., `92.6M`, `327.1K`) into full integers.  
  - Standardized engagement rates by stripping `%` signs and converting to numeric values.  
  - Filled missing values (e.g., engagement rate → 0, topic of influence → mode/unknown).  

- **SQL Transformations:**  
  - Created consistent column naming across all platforms.  
  - Extracted usernames from influencer names.  
  - Removed non-U.S. entries for platform-specific analysis.  

- **Power BI Dashboard:**  
  - KPIs for **Total Influencers, Average Engagement, and Potential Reach**.  
  - **Top 5 Followers** visual to highlight reach concentration.  
  - **Line & Clustered Column Chart** showing Engagement Rate vs Followers.  
  - **Top 5 Potential Reach** visual for campaign targeting.  
  - Platform filter (Instagram, Threads, TikTok, YouTube) for cross-platform insights.  

- **Business Insights:**  
  - Mega influencers = **large reach but low engagement** → great for awareness campaigns.  
  - Micro-influencers = **high engagement with smaller audiences** → great for targeted, community-driven campaigns.
